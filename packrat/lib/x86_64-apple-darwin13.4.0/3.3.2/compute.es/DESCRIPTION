Description: This package contains several functions for calculating
    the most widely used effect sizes (ES), along with their variances,
    confidence intervals and p-values.  The output includes ES's of d
    (mean difference), g (unbiased estimate of d), r (correlation
    coefficient), z' (Fisher's z), and OR (odds ratio and log odds
    ratio). In addition, NNT (number needed to treat), U3, CLES (Common
    Language Effect Size) and Cliff's Delta are computed. This package
    uses recommended formulas as described in The Handbook of Research
    Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine, 2009).
