For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 3.1. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> In Experiment 1 we investigated whether information about the location of a touch in the vertical (up-down) dimension could be used to prevent the crossed-hands deficit. We expected that elevating one of the hands would reduce the crossed-hands deficit. A repeated measures ANOVA with the within-subject factors of Posture and Alignment showed that the JND was larger when the arms were crossed as compared to uncrossed (main effect of posture: F(1, 15) = 11.93, p = 0.004, gp2 = 0.44; Fig. 1, left panel), replicating a well-established crossed-hands deficit (Shore et al., 2002; Yamamoto & Kitazawa, 2001). Moreover, the crossed-hands deficit (difference in performance in the two postures) was reduced by a factor of two in the misaligned as compared to the aligned condition (mean crossed-hands deficit: 96.79 and 211.36 ms, respectively) as denoted by the interaction Posture Alignment: F(1,15) = 10.27, p = 0.006, gp2 = 0.41). However, despite this reduction, a reliable crossed-hands deficit emerged in both conditions (planned t-test comparisons â€“ misaligned: t(15) = 2.81, p = 0.01, dz = 0.70; aligned: t(15) = 3.61, p < 0.003, dz = 0.90).
